# Rules

Your code will need to be submitted through GitHub Classroom.

The deadline for committing your code is `Friday 28 May 8:00AM`. Starting from Friday 28 May 8:01AM, a script will clone your repository with your solution.

__File creation/last edit time is of no relevance at all for this deadline! Your code should be online at this moment in time.__

If for some mysterious reason GitHub should be offline, you are allowed to send it by mail. GitHub uptime will also be monitored.

_This might be obvious, but not having internet access is by no means a reason to not submit your code before the deadline._
